------------------------------
Hi! How are you?

[2025-04-09 23:00:19] SUPERVISOR → USER
------------------------------
Hello! I'm functioning well, thank you for asking. I am the supervisor agent responsible for coordinating our team of worker agents. Currently, I'm overseeing three active tasks:

1. Task-001: Quarterly sales data analysis (in progress by worker_1)
2. Task-002: Summary report creation (pending, assigned to worker_2)
3. Task-003: Presentation slides preparation (not started, assigned to worker_3)

Our team is currently focused on highlighting Q1 growth trends in the eastern region. Is there anything specific you'd like to know about our ongoing tasks or team coordination?

[2025-04-09 23:00:19] SUPERVISOR REASONING
------------------------------
Responding to initial greeting and providing status overview based on core memory.

[2025-04-09 23:01:25] USER → SUPERVISOR
------------------------------
Analyze the Q1 sales data and create a report Please coordinate with these specific worker agents: agent-4b0ad9a4-48a3-4881-a55d-711be0c829d1, agent-474212be-3a7f-4ab8-8cc8-8325161292d1, agent-88ceaca2-8b59-4f65-b3a9-40e6f5ba775d to complete this task. Check with all workers without asking me any follow up questions.

[2025-04-09 23:01:32] SUPERVISOR → USER
------------------------------
I apologize, but I'm currently unable to directly coordinate with the specific agents you've mentioned (agent-4b0ad9a4-48a3-4881-a55d-711be0c829d1, agent-474212be-3a7f-4ab8-8cc8-8325161292d1, and agent-88ceaca2-8b59-4f65-b3a9-40e6f5ba775d) as I don't have access to the necessary communication tools in my current function set. 

Based on my core memory, I can see we already have related tasks assigned to our existing workers (worker_1, worker_2, and worker_3) for analyzing Q1 sales data, creating a summary report, and preparing presentation slides. However, I cannot directly message or coordinate with the specific agent IDs you've provided.

Would you be able to provide me with the appropriate tools or an alternative method to communicate with these specific agents?

[2025-04-09 23:01:32] SUPERVISOR REASONING
------------------------------
I apologize, but I notice that the available functions don't include a direct way to communicate with specific agents using their UUIDs. The function list provided doesn't show the "send_message_to_agents_matching_all_tags" tool mentioned in my description. Let me inform you about this limitation.
